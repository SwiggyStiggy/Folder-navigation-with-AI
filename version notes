v 1.0 - GUI set up. AI implemntation,. speech recognition implemntation.
V 1.1 - GUI alteration. 2 windows open on startup: App and File explorer. AI now detects folder_name, drive_name and BACKTRACK-function.
V 1.2 - Added ability to run .exe files, still buggy from the logic side.
V 1.3 - running .EXE files(bugfix). Missing the voice command execution, it was only displayed in RSSD but not passed/interpreted into a structured command. 
V 1.4 - Change the folder url itself so it moves in the same window and doesnt open a new one
V 1.5 - AI had issues with ' ' (space) recognition. Prompt was changed for this. There were issues with speech_recognition as well. Was low energy threshold.
